1. **Headline**: "SWE | 90% Test Coverage Advocate | GPU Computing | Building at UserAuthGuard"

2. **About Section**:
```
🚀 Full-stack engineer who ships production code that impacts real users.

Currently @ UserAuthGuard, where I'm pushing 90% test coverage across our Django platform while refactoring legacy systems into maintainable, tested code.

Previously @ Bessemer Trust, I built a securities platform that saved 20+ analysts 60% of their reconciliation time and delivered an AI Tech Talk to 500+ employees.

🛠️ What I bring to the table:
- Production experience with Django, React, .NET, and AWS
- Obsession with testing (90% coverage is the minimum)
- GPU programming (4.6× speedup on distributed AlexNet)
- Teaching ability (120+ students, 90% cert pass rate)

🎯 What excites me:
- YC startups building the future
- Systems that scale to millions
- Teams that ship fast and test everything
- Problems that matter

📊 By the numbers:
- 60% time reduction in production systems
- 90%+ test coverage standard
- 4.6× GPU performance improvements
- 500+ engineers educated

Let's build something that matters.

#### My Other More Worky Work 💼
- Shipped production code @ **Bessemer Trust** that cut reconciliation time by 60%
- Taught 120+ students @ **The Coding Place** with 90% cert pass rate
- Built event systems @ **Project Innovate** used by 9 programs daily
